# CAM-Convs

This is a self implementation of the CVPR 2019 paper [*CAM-Convs: Camera-Aware Multi-Scale Convolutions for Single-View Depth*](http://webdiis.unizar.es/~jmfacil/camconvs/). The implementations are based on the [original paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02028?context=cs) and the supplementary materials provided by [Jose M. Facil](https://webdiis.unizar.es/~jmfacil/).(Thanks again!)

Now it's only a version for test, and the APIs are still a mess. They'll get changed later.

Presently the code hasn't been runned under the environments in the paper. So chances are huge that the code are not rid of bugs. Full testing should be performed later.

I am new to PyTorch and CNN, so any kind of suggestions shall be welcomed and highly appreciated.
